# Solmali and the Forest spirit

![img]({{ '/assets/images/solmali_cover.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }*Orginally Created By Yako Gureishi*

"When a golem discovers a young human girl in the forest that he protects, the two set out on a journey in search of other humans, whom are considered to be nearly extinct. The world is ruled by spirits, goblins, and all manner of strange creatures. Human beings are persecuted, to the very point of extinction." - [IMBD's wonderful summary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11428586/plotsummary/)

# So, Why this anime?

There are many things that make this anime really awesome, notobly, in nearly all scenes, there is an underlying sense of dread juxtaposed with the stunning back grounds and upbeat tone.

This anime kept me hooked the whole way through, which is quite an accomplishment in this day and age. It also contains a few pretty good action scenes throughout. It deals with a lot of dark themes for a slow burning slice of life anime adn really tugs at the heart strings.

What really makes this anime awesome is the bond between "Solmali and The Forest Spirit" (Crazy I know). They have such a wonderful Father/Daughter relationship that the world itself seems to want rip apart. I highly recommend watching it!

If you have decided to go and watch it, keep in mind that the anime is likely never gouing to recive a season 2 I dont think the manga will ever be complete. This is because the creator, Yako Gureishi, has been suffering from certain health problems. I hope she recovers so we might one day see the finale of this wonderful anime, and so, you know, shell be alive and stuff too! 

# The end

I dont think this post was very good, or very long, or much of anyhting, but I just wanted to practice writing and get something down on paper.
